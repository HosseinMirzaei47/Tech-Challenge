# Angular  Challenge
A responsive card ui based Material design, to be implemented by Angular

## Introduction
In this challenge you are going develop a card which is reusable in every where of project.

Each card has at least 3 items, which must be dynamic :
1. Card title.
2. Button title.
3. Button color(primary, secondary,‚Ä¶).
4. Button event.
5. Content of card.

In main page, call the card component and fill inputs(Title, button title, button color).
Notice: The content of the Card, can be Html.

In content of the card in main page:
We have a count down timer with every 10s, the background color of the card randomly changes.

User is able to edit card title by clicking on edit icon in front of it, and save it (just saved it locally, no need to send the saved data to the server). with refreshing page, if user custom title is exist, must Replaced with default title.

## Expectations

1. We expect a **clean**, **readable** and **maintainable** code with **meaningful comments**.
2. It would be better if the project uses a **bundle tools** like **Webpack** or parcel.
3. Although this is a small test project, complete it with the **mindset of a big project**. (then **structres** and **naming** of the files are very important)
4. As mentioned above it is more valuable to us that the project comes with **unit tests**

## Task

1. Either clone or private fork this repository (if you don't know how to do that, Google is your friend)
2. Develop the given challenge
3. Commit and Push your code to your new repository
3. Send us an email and notify us of completion! We'll take care about the rest and get back to you.
### Code Quality

Integrate your project with [codacy](http://codacy.com/). We do like to see your code quality, coverage and branch report. You'll need to setup code analysis and coverage report at codacy.

**Please do not start development before getting a confirmation from us**.

Happy Coding! ‚úäüèª
